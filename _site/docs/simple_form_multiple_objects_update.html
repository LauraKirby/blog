<p>In my Rails template view I have a list of items that be updated one at a time.
I would like to add functionality to update all the items at once with a ‘select all’ option.
See example of concept below from my Gmail account below.</p>


<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>Option to select “All”.</p>

<p>All emails on page have been selected.</p>

<p>Now, I can click on “Mark as read” to update all emails that have been selected.</p>

<p>The issue is that Simple Form assumes that when you update multiple objects at once, that will have a parent object. For example an email may `belong_to` a `user` and a `user` may `has_many` `emails`. In which case you could build a form for `user` and update the `emails` attribute.</p>

<p>In my scenario, we have a model without associations. Meaning, I want to update <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">emails</pre> based on the email id without relation to a `user` object.</p>

<p>We were about to achieve this through building some custom html within the Simple Form generator.</p>

<h2>Routing</h2>
<p>I want post to post data to `/emails/read_all`.</p>
<b>Create route and corresponding action:</b><br>
- Add email resource and preferred route.<br>
- I have implemented 'PUT' since I am doing a partial update.<br>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
    # /config/routes.rb
    resources :emails do
       put :read, on: :member
       put :read_all, on: :collection
    end
</pre>
<br>
- Add a nearly empty action to the emails controller.
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
    # /controllers/emails_controller.rb
    def read_all
      redirect_to emails_path
    end
</pre>
<br>
<b>Route within Simple Form:</b>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
 # /views/email/index.html.erb
 &lt;%= simple_form_for Email.new, as: :emails, url: read_all_emails_path, method: :put do |f| %&gt;
</pre>
<br>
<b>Verify the request:</b><br>
- Take a look at your server logs. After clicking “submit” on your form, you should see something like:<br>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">`Started PUT "/emails/read_all" for 127.0.0.1 at 2016-12-09 12:12:45 -0800`
</pre>
